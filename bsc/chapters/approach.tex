\label{ch:approach}
Page budget for Approach 20 - 30 pages
\begin{itemize}
    \item This chapter describes your main contributions (i.e., what you did) and the decisions that went into them (i.e., why did you did it the way you did it).
    
\end{itemize}
\section{Analysis and Requirements}
Describe the analysis of the problem and the specific requirements.

\section{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This section should explain the high-level design
    \item Include possibly an architecture figure that shows how the different parts fit together and what processing/technology/tools/datasets have been used for the different components.
\end{itemize}
    
    Name these themes based on the different components or sub-problems you are solving in your thesis.
    
    \section{Component 1}
    \section{Component 2}
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item For larger/more complex projects, the separate components may be chapters on their own chapters on their own (e.g., back-end vs. front-end).
    \item Include screenshots, examples, tables, algorithms (with pseudo code), plots for some preliminary observations leading to some aspect of your approach decisions, etc. so that it's not just text.
    \item Always discuss the alternatives considered and the rationale for the choosing the solutions you adopted.
    \item You may include code snippets for interesting/challenging (sub)problems, but it is not the idea to walk through the source code line-by-line.
\end{itemize}
