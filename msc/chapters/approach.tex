\section{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This section should explain the high-level design
    \item Include possibly an architecture figure that shows how the different parts fit together and what processing/technology/tools/datasets have been used for the different components.
\end{itemize}
    
    Name these themes based on the different components or sub-problems you are solving in your thesis.
    
    \section{Theme 1}
    \section{Theme 2}
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item For larger/more complex projects, the separate themes may be chapters on their own (e.g., components in a system; sub-problems of a major evaluation study; etc.).
    \item Include screenshots, examples, tables, algorithms (with pseudo code), plots for some preliminary observations leading to some aspect of your approach decisions, etc. so that it's not just text.
    \item Always discuss the alternatives considered and the rationale for the choosing the solutions you adopted.
\end{itemize}
